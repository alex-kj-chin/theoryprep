The materials are listed by week below, and are summarized in calendar form above (the calendar omits optional sections, so see below for those). For each week, there are videos and readings. The videos are meant to cover the content at a high level with intuition, motivation, and  in-depth explanations of how to do more complex proofs. We recommend that you watch these first to get a sense of the material for the week. The readings cover the details, so they will often have more definitions and lots of smaller proofs. Certain sections are required reading for each week, but we've also listed optional sections in case you find yourself wanting to learn more! Problem sets will assume that you understand the material from both of these sources. We will publish the materials on the Thursday preceding each week.

### Readings for Week 1 (Finish by June 1st, or first problem session date)
 - The videos cover [introduction to proofs](https://youtu.be/fMDiUny5cFc), [proofs of existence and nonexistence](https://youtu.be/JRrtW-K5j24), and [proving if and only if statements](https://youtu.be/sLtvZaw8LTo).
 - From Math for CS: Read the introduction through section 1.3 (pages 3-9). Read sections 1.5 (skip 1.5.2--we'll cover contrapositive next week), 1.6, 1.8, and 1.9. Read Section 3.6 through 3.6.5 (it's okay if you don't understand the second part in 3.6.5 applying DeMorgan's Laws). Read Chapter 4 through 4.1.4. It's a lot of sections, so we compiled them together [here](/theoryprep/assets/Week_1_Readings.pdf).
 - Optional Sections: Math for CS 1.4 (inference rules are unnecessary for this course), Building Blocks Chapter 3 - 3.7 (these cover the proof strategies outlined in the videos for quantifier proofs if you would like to see them again), Math for CS 3.6.6 (more interesting facts about quantifiers), Math for CS 4.1.5 (more interesting facts about sets)

### Problem Set for Week 1 (Finish by June 7th)
 - The first problem set is available as a [pdf](/theoryprep/assets/Week_1_pset.pdf) and [tex](/theoryprep/assets/Week_1_tex.zip). We're providing course support for Overleaf (although you're welcome to use any editor of your choice). In Overleaf, click the "New Project", "Upload Project", and then drag and drop the linked zip file. If you've never used LaTeX before, see our [resources on LaTeX](/theoryprep/latex).

### Readings for Week 2 (Finish by first session of second week of problem sessions)
 - The videos cover [the contrapositive](https://youtu.be/Eg9oMdJ00Ms), [proof by casework (or exhaustion)](https://youtu.be/X3yx5dhC6mU), and [induction](https://youtu.be/n1ZI_HqGAYc).
 - From Math for CS: Read Sections 1.5.2, 1.7, and 5 (Section 5.3 may be a bit confusing since we have not discussed the well-ordering principle--feel free to review it after doing 1a on the problem set where we introduce the well-ordering principle). We compiled them again [here](/theoryprep/assets/Week_2_Readings.pdf).
 - Optional Sections: Building Blocks 2.6, 3.12, 3.13, 11 (if you're intereseted in seeing other presentations of this material--beware that some of the examples may require content we have not covered).

### Problem Set for Week 2 (Finish by June 14th)
 - [pdf](/theoryprep/assets/Week_2_pset.pdf) and [tex](/theoryprep/assets/Week_2_tex.zip).

### Readings for Week 3
 - The videos cover [defining infinite set size](https://youtu.be/HK3zxS7uTek) and [different sizes of infinity](https://youtu.be/arz0hnOmVzQ).
 - The readings are [here](/theoryprep/assets/Week_3_Readings.pdf).

### Problem Set for Week 3 (Finish by June 21st)
 - [pdf](/theoryprep/assets/Week_3_pset.pdf) and [tex](/theoryprep/assets/Week_3_tex.zip).

### Week 4 Materials
 - Videos on [undirected graphs](https://youtu.be/Y1GX5Ld8vlk) and [directed graphs](https://youtu.be/K9P54DQQVPk).
 - Readings are [here](/theoryprep/assets/Week_4_Readings.pdf).
 - Pset available as a [pdf](/theoryprep/assets/Week_4_pset.pdf) and [tex](/theoryprep/assets/Week_4_tex.zip).

### Week 5 Materials
 - Videos on [reading definitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6J7EQJ4puY) and [reading proofs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ9D5ul-Sew).
 - Readings are available [here](/theoryprep/assets/Week_5_Readings.pdf).
 - Pset available as a [pdf](/theoryprep/assets/Week_5_pset.pdf) and [tex](/theoryprep/assets/Week_5_tex.zip).
 - Reading with box deleted (see pset) [here](/theoryprep/assets/Week_5_Readings_unboxed.pdf).

### Week 6 Materials
 - Reductions are a tricky topic, and we're covering multiple different types of reductions. All the core problem set questions will be on the material from the first video and first 12 pages of the readings, so please focus your time there first (you'll get more out of the course if you make sure you really understand that material rather than if you watch everything at a cursory level).
 - Videos on [uncomputability and reductions](https://youtu.be/XoPoKyusUXk) and [polynomial time reductions](https://youtu.be/y9WWMTdhcDA).
 - Readings are [here](/theoryprep/assets/Week_6_Readings.pdf).
 - Pset as a [pdf](/theoryprep/assets/Week_6_pset.pdf) and [tex](/theoryprep/assets/Week_6_tex.zip).

### Week 7 Materials
 - Videos on [asymptotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv8kbPBRM7s) and [recurrence relations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGn2dudKUi0).
 - Readings are [here](/theoryprep/assets/Week_7_Readings.pdf).
 - Pset available as a [pdf](/theoryprep/assets/Week_7_pset.pdf) and [tex](/theoryprep/assets/Week_7_tex.zip).
 - Reading with deleted box (see pset) [here](/theoryprep/assets/Week_7_Readings_unboxed.pdf).

### Week 8 Materials
 - A longer video on [depth first search](https://youtu.be/8r_UdR1zOW8).
 - Readings is [here](/theoryprep/assets/Week_8_Readings.pdf).
 - Pset as a [pdf](/theoryprep/assets/Week_8_pset.pdf) and [tex](/theoryprep/assets/Week_8_tex.zip).
