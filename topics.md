title: What topics will we cover?
subtitle:
---

We will cover much of the material in from CS20, removing some of the material we feel is less important and adding some additional topics (for example reductions) that feature heavily in CS 121 and 124. Below is a tentative list of the topics for the course.

## CS20 Topics
- What is a Proof?
- Notation and quantifiers
- Sets, functions, and countability
- Graphs (directed and undirected)
- Proof techniques (proof by contradiction, proof by induction, proof of universal statements, etc)

## CS121 Preparation
- Computability Reductions
- Uncomputability Reductions

## CS124 Preparation
- How to read and write long proofs
- Assymptotics and recurrence relations
- Algorithmic analysis
