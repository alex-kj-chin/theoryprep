title: What topics will we cover?
subtitle:
---

We will cover much of the material in from CS20, removing some of the material we feel is less important and adding some additional topics (for example reductions) that feature heavily in CS 121 and 124. Below is a tentative list of the topics for the course.

## CS20 Topics
- Notation and quantifiers
- Sets and functions
- Relations and countability
- Graphs (directed and undirected)
- Assymptotic notation
- Proof techniques (proof by contradiction, proof by induction, proof of universal statements, et cetera)

## CS121 Preparation
- Reductions (we'll spend most of the time preparing this since it's integral to CS 121)
- Basic probability

## CS124 Preparation
- How to read and write long proofs
- Complex inductive proofs
