## Books

We'll use two books in this course. Primarily, we will take readings from [Mathematics for Computer Science](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf) (Math for CS). There may also be some readings from Building Blocks from [Theoretical Computer Science](http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/building-blocks/version-1.3/whole-book.pdf) (Building Blocks).
