## What is LaTeX?
Pronounced Lay-tech or Lah-tech, LaTeX is a markup language that makes it easier to write mathematical equations. It's difficult to write mathematics in a program like word or google docs--LaTeX makes it much easier. We recommend you use it to write up your problem sets (this is also good preparation for 121, 124, and beyond when you'll need to know LaTeX).

## Tools
- [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com) is used to write an compile latex online. It's great. Here's a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5EWoPOnZTU).
- [DeTexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) is a neat tool that gives you the LaTeX syntax for symbols that you draw.
