# Announcements

(05/23) Thank you to everyone who signed up for TheoryPrep. We're super excited to begin on June 1st! Stay tuned in the upcoming week for more information about Problem Session scheduling and other logistics.

# Important Note

We are asking that students **sign up for this course by 11:59 PM PT on Friday, May 22nd**. This is so that we can make sure we have sufficient staff for the course. Please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScT5o_LteVsXtjGM6H6AigaynKcO9ZO1iX--UqDRsn7xx1igA/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you are taking the course. We understand that people's schedules are in flux due to COVID-19, so if you are unsure if you will be taking the course, feel free to email us at [theoryprep@gmail.com](mailto:theoryprep@gmail.com).

## What is TheoryPrep?

TheoryPrep is a **completely free** (there is no cost for the course and no required materials to purchase) Harvard CS resource by students for students. The common CS series of 121 and 124 is **substantially more mathematically intensive than CS 50/51**, and for students with less mathematical maturity, this can be a large step up. TheoryPrep is a summer course that aims to help students prepare for these courses so they can get the most out of them. It has substantial overlap with CS20, with some additional topics we think are particularly important for 121/124. Our team is composed of former and future CS TFs (especially for CS 20, 121, and 124), and we want to use our experiences learning and teaching in 121/124 to help prepare you for them. Going in unprepared, these classes can be extremely difficult, but with some mathematical background, we believe you’ll be able to not only learn the material but appreciate **how cool it is!**

## Who is TheoryPrep for?

We believe that Computer Science should be accessible to everyone, and so TheoryPrep is open to any students! That said, we think students who have less familiarity with proof-based math will get the most out of this course, since it primarily focuses on the fundamentals of discrete math and constructing proofs. TheoryPrep is designed for you if you’ve taken fewer than 2 proof based classes at Harvard. If you have questions about whether TheoryPrep is a good fit, just email us at [theoryprep@gmail.com](mailto:theoryprep@gmail.com) and we’d be happy to help you figure it out. Note also that [CS20](https://www.summer.harvard.edu/course-catalog/courses) (also a great course!) is available as a summer course; the main differences are that our course focusses more directly on preparatoin for CS 121/124, is designed to be a manageable amount of work on top of a summer internship, and is free.

## What does the time commitment look like?

We estimate that TheoryPrep will take about 6 hours per week. Similarly to CS20, we will use a flipped classroom style, so there will be approximately 2 hours of reading/watching videos on your own time and 4 hours of working together on problems. The program will run for 8 weeks beginning on June 1st.
