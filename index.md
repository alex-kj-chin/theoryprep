## What is TheoryPrep?

TheoryPrep is a **completely free** (there is no cost for the course and no required materials to purchase) CS resource by students for students (we are **not affiliated** with the university). The common CS series of 121 and 124 is **substantially more mathematically intensive than CS 50/51**, and for students with less mathematical maturity, this can be a large step up. TheoryPrep is a summer course that aims to help students prepare for these courses so they can get the most out of them. It has substantial overlap with CS20, with some additional topics we think are particularly important for 121/124. Our team is composed of former and future CS TFs (especially for CS 20, 121, and 124), and we want to use our experiences learning and teaching in 121/124 to help prepare you for them. Going in unprepared, these classes can be extremely difficult, but with some mathematical background, we believe youâ€™ll be able to not only learn the material but appreciate **how cool it is!**

## Can I Still Sign Up?

While the official enrollment has closed, we are happy to work with you to see if you can still participate in the course. Please email us at [theoryprep@gmail.com](mailto:theoryprep@gmail.com) to discuss.

## I can't commit the full 6 hours per week. Can I audit the course?

All readings, videos, and problem sets will be posted on the website, and we encourage you to complete the course at any speed that fits your schedule! Please reach out to us with any questions at [theoryprep@gmail.com](mailto:theoryprep@gmail.com).
